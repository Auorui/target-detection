# Image-Adaptive YOLO (IA-YOLO) â€” PyTorch Implementation

> **Image-Adaptive YOLO for Object Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions**  
> [AAAI 2022 Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.08088) ï½œ [Original TensorFlow Code](https://github.com/wenyyu/Image-Adaptive-YOLO)  
> This repository provides a **PyTorch reimplementation** of IA-YOLO, focusing on object detection under **adverse weather conditions** (fog, low light, etc.).  
> The detection backbone here uses **YOLOv5n**, slightly different from the original YOLOv3 in the paper.
